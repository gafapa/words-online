# Ofimeo

Ofimeo (formerly "Words Online") is a collaborative office suite for schools
that runs entirely in the browser, with no server of its own. One static build hosts every app; documents live in each browser
(IndexedDB) and edits travel directly between browsers over WebRTC. Public
Nostr relays (WebSockets) are only used as a meeting point for browsers to
find each other.

| App | Name in the UI (en / es) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Word processor (`writer`) | Ofimeo Docs / Ofimeo Documentos | Available |
| Spreadsheet (`sheet`) | Ofimeo Sheets / Ofimeo Hojas de cálculo | Available |
| Drawing (`draw`) | Ofimeo Drawing / Ofimeo Dibujo | Available |
| Diagram (`diagram`) | Ofimeo Diagrams / Ofimeo Diagramas | Available |
| Presentation (`slides`) | Ofimeo Slides / Ofimeo Presentaciones | Available |

Storage keys and database names keep the historical `words-online` prefix
(`localStorage` `words-online:*`, IndexedDB and cache names), so documents made
before the rename keep working.

## Word processor

- Print layout with real pages: paper size (A4, A5, Letter, Legal), orientation
  and margins, page breaks, header and footer with page number / page count,
  footnotes at the foot of each page, zoom, and printing / PDF that matches the
  screen.
- Menu bar (File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Table, Tools, Review, Help), classic toolbar,
  context menu, status bar (page X of Y, words, characters) and keyboard shortcuts.
- Paragraph styles (Normal, Title, Subtitle, Headings), fonts, sizes in points,
  bold/italic/underline/strike, sub/superscript, text and highlight colors,
  alignment, line spacing, indentation, bulleted/numbered/check lists, quotes,
  code blocks, links, images (paste, drop, resize), special characters.
- Tables with merged cells, header rows, cell backgrounds and resizable columns.
- Find & replace, word count.
- **Word (.docx) and OpenDocument (.odt)**: open and download with headings,
  styles, lists, tables (merged cells, widths), images, footnotes, header/footer
  fields and page setup. Also opens `.html`, `.txt` and `.md`.
- Real-time collaboration with live cursors, presence and offline editing.

### Reviewing (teachers correcting student work)

- **Comments**: select text → *Comment* (toolbar, context menu, *Insert* or
  *Review* menu, Ctrl+Alt+M). Cards sit in a margin next to the page, aligned
  with their text (a bottom sheet on phones), with author, color, time, replies,
  resolve / reopen, edit and delete (own comments). Comments are anchored with
  Yjs relative positions and live in the session's comments channel, so they
  follow the text through concurrent edits and people with a *comment* link can
  add them without being able to edit the text. *View* links see them read-only.
- **Suggestions** (track changes): switch the toolbar mode from *Editing* to
  *Suggesting*. Typed text is underlined and deleted text struck through (not
  removed) in the author's color; deleting your own suggestion removes it.
  Each suggestion (or replacement) gets a card with accept / reject, and
  *Review* has accept all / reject all and next / previous. Local edits are
  rewritten before they are applied; remote changes and undo are never
  rewritten. Suggesting needs edit access (commenters comment instead).
  Paragraph splits/joins and formatting changes are applied directly.
- **Authorship**: *View → Show authorship* tints text in the color of whoever
  typed it, and *Contributions…* lists words, characters and share per author
  (for group work). Text carries the Yjs client id of its author (an
  `authorship` mark, so it survives paragraph splits); older text falls back to
  the client id of its Yjs items. Client ids map to people through
  `session.authors`.
- **Equations**: *Insert → Equation… / Display equation…* opens an editor
  (`src/ui/equation.ts`, shared by other apps) built on MathLive, with templates,
  symbols, a LaTeX field and a virtual keyboard for tablets. MathLive is loaded
  only when the editor opens; equations are rendered with KaTeX, whose fonts are
  bundled (offline). Double click (or Enter) edits an equation.
- **Files**: comments (with replies and resolved state), tracked changes and
  equations are written to and read from Word (`w:comment`, `w:ins` / `w:del`,
  Office Math) and OpenDocument (`office:annotation`, `text:tracked-changes`,
  embedded MathML formula objects). Equations go through KaTeX's MathML (LaTeX
  kept as annotation in ODT) and a MathML → OMML converter; OMML and MathML are
  converted back to LaTeX on import. Comments of an opened file move into the
  comments channel the first time an editor opens it.
- Access: *view* and *comment* links open the text read-only; the File menu has
  *Make a copy*, *Save version…* and *Version history…*.

### Spelling and grammar

Offline and private: checks run in a Web Worker in the browser and no text is
sent anywhere (unless a LanguageTool server is turned on, see below). Spanish,
Galician, English, French and German.

- **Spelling** (red wavy underline) with Hunspell dictionaries and our own
  checker (`spell/hunspell.ts`): stems and affix rules are kept as they are and
  affixes are stripped when a word is checked (two-level suffixes, prefixes,
  German compounds, `REP`/`MAP`/`KEY` suggestions). Loading takes 0.05–0.4 s;
  nspell, which expands every form up front, did not finish loading the
  Galician dictionary in 9 minutes (over 1 GB) and needs 7 s for French. Code
  blocks, inline code, URLs, emails, numbers, words with digits, acronyms in
  capitals and mixed-case names (`iPhone`) are skipped. The word being typed is
  underlined only once the cursor leaves it.
- **Grammar and style** (blue wavy / dotted underline): an offline rule set
  (`spell/rules/`, one file per language, each rule tagged with language and
  category): repeated words, double spaces, spaces before or missing after
  punctuation, capital letters at the start of paragraphs and sentences
  (abbreviations and initials excepted), `¿…?` / `¡…!` pairs (Spanish; in
  Galician the opening mark is optional, so only unclosed ones), French no-break
  spaces before `; : ! ?` and inside `« »` (suggested, as a style issue, where
  an ordinary space was typed), and frequent confusions only in unambiguous
  contexts: *a ver / haber*, *echo / hecho*, *halla / haya*, *sino / si no*,
  *ahí / hay*, *porque / por qué*, dequeísmo… (es), Castilianisms with the RAG
  forms (*entonces → entón*, *hasta → ata*, *desde luego → desde logo*; *pero →
  mais* only as an optional style suggestion) (gl), *a / à*, *ça / sa*,
  *quelque fois*, *on a pas*, *si il* (fr), *das / dass* after verbs of saying
  and thinking, *seit / seid*, *als / wie* after comparatives (de). English
  grammar also uses [Harper](https://writewithharper.com) (WebAssembly, about
  8 MB compressed, loaded only for English text). Rule tests:
  `node scripts/test-spell.mjs`.
- Right click an underlined word: up to five suggestions, *Ignore*, *Ignore
  all* (this session), *Add to dictionary* (a personal dictionary per language,
  kept in this browser; *Tools → Personal dictionary…* lists and removes
  words). Grammar issues show their explanation in the interface language
  (Harper's and LanguageTool's messages come in the text's language) and
  *Ignore this kind of issue*.
- **Tools → Spelling and grammar…** (F7): walks through the issues from the
  cursor, like Word or LibreOffice: *Change*, *Change all*, *Ignore*, *Ignore
  all* / *Ignore rule*, *Add to dictionary*, *Next*. The dialog is not modal.
- **Language**: each document has a language (*Tools → Language*, also the
  status bar), shared with collaborators; until one is chosen, the interface
  language is used. Paragraphs can have their own (*Tools → Language →
  Selected paragraphs*, a `lang` attribute written to Word as `w:lang` and to
  OpenDocument as `fo:language` / `fo:country`, and read back). Templates set
  the language of their content.
- *Tools → Check spelling as you type* / *Check grammar as you type* switch
  the underlines off (remembered in this browser); the browser's own spell
  checker is used only while ours is off.
- Underlines are ProseMirror decorations: the document and its Yjs state are
  never changed, collaborators do not see each other's underlines or ignored
  words, and they are not printed. Only paragraphs that changed are checked
  again (ProseMirror reuses unchanged nodes; results are cached by text), after
  a short pause in typing, nearest to the cursor first.
- **LanguageTool** (optional, off by default): *Tools → Grammar → Use a
  LanguageTool server…* takes the address of a
  [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) server (open source; a school can
  host its own) whose `/v2/check` results are merged with the offline ones
  (overlapping issues are shown once; its spelling results are not used). The
  dialog warns that the text of checked documents is sent to that server.
- Dictionaries are separate files (`dictionaries/<lang>-<hash>.aff.txt` /
  `.dic.txt`, generated by `scripts/spell-dictionaries.mjs` from the
  `dictionary-*` packages without their morphological fields, so the Galician
  one goes from 9.5 MB to 2.4 MB, 0.7 MB compressed), downloaded the first
  time a language is checked and then cached by the service worker, like
  Harper's WebAssembly: after one use, checking works offline.
- Measured (Chromium, 56-page document, 27,000 words): first full check
  0.6–0.8 s (dictionary download included; 3.2 s for English, which loads
  Harper); keystroke-to-paint while typing in the middle of the document
  34 ms median with checking vs 30 ms without (the rest is layout of the
  pages). The Galician dictionary takes about 55 MB of memory in the worker
  (Spanish 11 MB); Harper about 100 MB more.

## Spreadsheet

- Built on [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) (Apache-2.0, open-source presets only):
  multiple sheets, formulas (hundreds of functions), number formats, styles,
  borders, merged cells, freeze panes, filters, sorting, conditional formatting,
  data validation, tables, hyperlinks, notes, images and find & replace.
- Real-time collaboration without a server (see below), with collaborators'
  selections shown in their color.
- Open and download **Excel (.xlsx)**, **OpenDocument (.ods)** and **CSV**;
  print / PDF of the current sheet.

### How spreadsheet sync works

Univer describes every change as a replayable *mutation*. The shared state is a
base snapshot plus an append-only log of mutations in a `Y.Array`; Yjs gives all
replicas the same log order, so replaying it always yields the same workbook.

- Local changes apply immediately and are appended to the log.
- If a concurrent change lands before local ones, edits of different cells are
  applied directly (order does not matter); anything else triggers a rebuild in
  the shared order, so replicas never diverge.
- Each entry records which changes its author had seen. An edit made without
  knowing about a concurrent row/column insertion or deletion is shifted before
  replaying, so it lands on the cell its author meant.
- Checkpoints (snapshot + covered entries) every 300 changes keep loading fast.

## Drawing

- Built on [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) (MIT): shapes,
  arrows that bind to shapes, freehand, text, images, frames, libraries, hand-drawn
  or clean style, light/dark theme.
- Collaborators' pointers and selections, live.
- Open and download `.excalidraw`; download PNG and SVG.
- Sync: each element is a value in a shared `Y.Map` (deleted elements stay as
  tombstones); local edits are detected with Excalidraw's per-element version and
  remote edits never enter the local undo history. Fonts are served locally.

## Diagrams

- Our own editor built on [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph)
  (Apache-2.0, the TypeScript successor of mxGraph, the engine behind draw.io),
  about 170 KB gzipped and loaded only when a diagram is opened.
- **draw.io compatible**: opens and downloads `.drawio` files (compressed or
  not, multiple pages, user objects) with the same style strings, so diagrams
  move between both editors. Pasting draw.io XML also works.
- Shapes and markers ported from draw.io (general, flowchart, UML, entity
  relation, basic, arrows and connectors) in a searchable shape panel; click
  to insert or drag onto the canvas or into a container.
- **More shapes**: draw.io's other shape libraries (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud,
  IBM, Cisco, Kubernetes, network, BPMN, ArchiMate, C4, SysML, UML 2.5, floor
  plans, mockups, electrical, P&ID, racks, and more: 62 entries, about 14,000
  shapes) can be enabled from *View → More shapes…* or the button under the
  shape panel. They are generated at build time from the pinned draw.io release
  (`scripts/build-diagram-libs.mjs`) and downloaded only when used: a library
  when it is enabled, the stencils and shape code of a diagram when it is
  opened (so files using them render as in draw.io). Everything used once is
  cached and keeps working offline.
- **Hand-drawn style** (draw.io's `sketch=1`, drawn with rough.js with the same
  per-shape seed, fill styles such as hachure or zigzag) and a hand-drawn font,
  both available offline.
- Connection points, orthogonal/elbow/curved/entity-relation connectors, guides,
  rotation, grouping, containers, alignment and distribution, automatic layouts
  (tree, hierarchical, circle, organic), multiple pages, in-place label editing.
- Format panel (fill, gradient, line, pattern, opacity, shadow, text, arrows,
  position and size, raw style editing), context menu, keyboard shortcuts,
  copy/paste between diagrams (and images or text from other apps), zoom and pan.
- Download SVG and PNG (the selection or the whole page) and print / PDF.
- Collaborators' selections are highlighted, their pointers shown, and the page
  tabs show who is on each page.
- Sync is state-based: Yjs holds pages → cells → fields, so concurrent edits merge
  per field (one person moves a shape while another recolors it). Remote edits
  never enter the local undo history.
- Labels are edited as rich text (bold, lists, colors) when they are HTML.
- Links with view or comment access open the diagram read-only: zoom, pan,
  pages, downloads and presence keep working.

## Presentations

Slides for the classroom, built on the diagram editor (same shapes, libraries,
hand-drawn style, sync and presence). Each slide is a diagram page with a fixed
16:9 (960×540) or 4:3 (960×720) frame; content outside the frame is kept but not
presented or exported.

- Slide panel with live thumbnails, drag to reorder, context menu (new,
  duplicate, delete, move, layout, background) and keyboard navigation; the
  shape panel is the second tab. Who is on each slide is shown on its thumbnail.
- Themes (Light, Dark, Ocean, Paper, Chalkboard, Fresh: background, fonts and
  colors) and layouts (Title, Title and content, Two columns, Section header,
  Title only, Blank) with "Click to add title" placeholders. Changing the theme
  restyles every placeholder and text box that has no color or font of its own.
- Rich text boxes (bold, italic, underline, bullets, numbering, sizes, colors,
  alignment), images (insert, paste, drop), shapes, arrows and icons from the
  shape libraries, tables and equations (MathLive editor, rendered as MathML).
- Speaker notes per slide under the canvas, edited together in real time.
- **Present**: full screen, arrows / Space / Page Up / Page Down / click / swipe,
  slide counter, laser pointer (L), black screen (B), Esc to end. **Presenter
  view** in a second window: current and next slide, notes, timer.
- **Follow the presenter**: when someone presents, everyone else in the
  presentation sees a *Follow* button; followers see the presenter's slide and
  laser pointer (through awareness) until the presentation ends. View-only
  links work too, so students can follow the teacher's slides.
- Download **PowerPoint (.pptx)** (text boxes, basic shapes, lines and arrows,
  tables and notes stay editable; other shapes become pictures), **OpenDocument
  (.odp)**, **PDF** (print, one slide per page at the slide size), PNG of a
  slide or of all slides (.zip). **Open .pptx** files: text boxes and
  placeholders (positions and sizes from the layout and master, bullets, theme
  colors), shapes, pictures, connectors, tables, backgrounds and notes.
- Hand in: the .pptx plus a PNG of every slide.

## Templates

The home screen has a **Templates** gallery for schools. Template content is
written in Spanish, Galician, French and German; the two tied to Spanish
regulations (LOMLOE learning situation, as a document and as a presentation)
exist in Spanish and Galician only and are hidden for French and German content.
The content language follows the interface language (with the English interface,
the browser's languages, else Spanish) and a switch changes it. French and German
versions keep the 0–10 grade scale with the pass mark at 5, labelled with the
usual mentions (Insuffisant … Très bien) or school grades (Mangelhaft … Sehr gut),
and use their own attendance codes (A/J/R, F/E/V). Filter by app, click a card and a new local document is
created and opened.

| App | Templates |
| --- | --- |
| Document | Situación de aprendizaje (identification, justification, specific competences, evaluation criteria, basic knowledge, activity sequence, UDL/DUA, evaluation), rubric, student worksheet, student report (cover, index, sections, APA bibliography), meeting minutes, letter to families with a consent slip |
| Spreadsheet | Gradebook (weighted averages per term from a weights sheet, final grade, IN/SU/BI/NT/SB level, pass/fail colors, group statistics), weekly timetable, monthly attendance register (weekdays from month/year, F/J/R codes, totals and attendance %), rubric with automatic score |
| Diagram | Concept map, timeline, process flowchart, graphic organizers (KWL, Venn, cause and effect) |
| Drawing | Brainstorm board |
| Presentation | Learning situation presentation, student oral presentation |

Templates are generated in code (no network) and go through each app's own
import path: HTML for documents, a workbook snapshot for spreadsheets,
`.drawio` XML for diagrams, `.excalidraw` for drawings and `.pptx` for
presentations. The gallery and each app's templates are separate chunks, loaded
only when the home screen shows them or a template is used.

## Accessibility

The **Accessibility** button (app bar and home screen, or `Alt+Shift+A`) opens a
panel with per-user preferences. They are saved in this browser and apply to the
whole suite; nothing changes in the documents themselves.

- **Reading fonts**: OpenDyslexic or Atkinson Hyperlegible for the interface
  and, optionally, for document text in the word processor. The document text
  option is *display only*: saved fonts, downloads and printing are unchanged
  (page breaks on screen may move while it is on). Fonts are self-hosted and work
  offline.
- **Text size** of the suite's interface (100–200 %), **line and letter spacing**
  for reading documents (display only).
- **Themes**: light, dark, follow the system, high contrast dark and high
  contrast light (all text at least 7:1, verified). Document pages, sheets,
  drawings and diagram canvases keep their own colors so their content stays
  readable.
- **Reduce motion**, **large mouse pointer**, **thick focus outline**.
- **Reading ruler** or **focus mask** that follows the pointer and, in text
  editors, the text cursor.
- **Read aloud** (`Alt+Shift+R`): reads the selection, or the paragraph with the
  cursor, or the whole document, with the browser's voices. The language
  (Spanish, Galician, English, French, German) is detected from the text; when no Galician voice
  is installed it reads with a Spanish one and says so. The word being read is
  highlighted without touching the document.
- **Dictation** (`Alt+Shift+D`): writes what you say at the text cursor of the
  word processor, a diagram label, a spreadsheet cell being edited or any text
  field. It uses the browser's speech recognition (Chrome, Edge), which needs an
  internet connection; the panel says when it is unavailable or offline.
- **Keyboard**: a *Skip to content* link, `F10` (or `Alt+Shift+M`) focuses the
  menu bar; arrow keys, `Enter` and `Escape` work in menus, submenus and toolbar
  pop-ups, and focus returns to the document. Dialogs, menus and toolbar buttons
  carry ARIA roles and names.

## Languages

The whole suite is available in **Spanish** (Spain), **Galician** (following
the RAG norms), **English**, **French** and **German** (terminology of
LibreOffice / Microsoft Office in each language; French typography with no-break
spaces before `: ; ! ?` and « », German „…“ quotes and formal *Sie*).

- The language is the one chosen in the language selector (home screen bar, or
  *Accessibility → Interface language*), saved in this browser; otherwise the
  browser's languages decide: Galician for `gl`, Spanish for any Spanish locale
  and for the other languages of Spain (Catalan, Basque…), French and German for
  any of their regional variants (`fr-CA`, `de-AT`, `de-CH`…), English otherwise.
  Changing it reloads the page. `<html lang>` follows it.
- UI strings are written in English in the code and wrapped with `t('…')`
  (`src/core/i18n.ts`; `{name}` placeholders, `tn()` for singular / plural).
  The catalogs (`src/core/locales/es.ts`, `gl.ts`, `fr.ts`, `de.ts`) are keyed by the English
  text and loaded on demand with a top-level `await`, so `t()` is ready before
  any module runs; missing entries fall back to English. Key names in shortcuts
  follow the keyboard (`Mayús`/`Maiús`, `Maj`/`Entrée`/`Suppr`,
  `Strg`/`Umschalt`/`Eingabe`/`Entf`).
- Third-party editors get the same language: Excalidraw (`es-ES`, `gl-ES`,
  `fr-FR`, `de-DE`), MathLive (Spanish, French, German built in, Galician strings
  added by us) and Univer (`es-ES`, `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, loaded on demand; Univer
  has no Galician, so Galician users get its Spanish interface). Dates and
  numbers are formatted with `Intl` in the chosen language.
- Shape names of the built-in diagram libraries are translated; the draw.io
  libraries of *More shapes* keep their original (mostly product) names, only
  their groups are translated. Template content has its own language switch,
  which follows the interface language by default.
- Existing document content is never translated. The first page, slide and
  sheet of a new document keep fixed names ("Page-1", "Slide 1", "Sheet1") so
  that collaborators who create it at the same time agree on them.

## Offline and installable

Ofimeo is a Progressive Web App: install it from the browser (address bar
or menu → *Install*) and it works without a connection for individual work.

- A service worker precaches the suite and every app, so after the first visit
  everything works offline; the home screen shows when it is ready.
- Documents always live in the browser (IndexedDB), so creating, editing,
  opening and downloading files needs no network. Collaboration resumes by itself
  when peers are reachable again, and offline edits merge automatically.
- When installed, the app registers as a handler for `.docx`, `.odt`, `.xlsx`,
  `.ods`, `.csv`, `.drawio`, `.excalidraw` and `.pptx` files ("Open with").
- Updates are picked up automatically on the next visit.

## Nextcloud

Open documents from a Nextcloud server (schools often have one) and save them
back, with no server of our own: the browser talks WebDAV directly to
Nextcloud. Full guide: [docs/nextcloud.md](docs/nextcloud.md).

- **Account**: home screen → **Nextcloud** (or *File → Nextcloud account…*).
  *Log in with Nextcloud* (Login Flow v2: approve in a Nextcloud tab) or an
  **app password** (Nextcloud → *Personal settings → Security → Devices &
  sessions → Create new app password*; never the main password). *Test
  connection* tells apart a wrong address, an unreachable server, https→http,
  maintenance, wrong credentials and a server that blocks this site (CORS),
  and then shows the admin options below. *Sign out* forgets the password (and
  revokes it when it came from the login flow).
- **Open from Nextcloud…** (home screen and File menu): file browser with
  breadcrumbs, search in the folder, sorting and icons per app; the file is
  imported with the app's importer into a new local document **linked** to it.
- **Save to Nextcloud** (Ctrl+S) updates the linked file in its format;
  **Save to Nextcloud as…** chooses folder (or a new one), name and format
  (the app's download formats). Saves send the file's ETag (`If-Match`): if
  it changed in Nextcloud meanwhile you choose *Overwrite*, *Save as a copy* or
  *Cancel*. The app bar shows "Saved to Nextcloud at hh:mm" or unsaved changes.
  Optional autosave every 2–15 minutes (off by default).
- The link is kept in this browser's document index only: collaboration stays
  peer to peer, and only the person who linked the document saves it.
- **Hand in → Upload to a Nextcloud share link…** sends the hand-in ZIP to a
  teacher's *File drop* link (`https://host/s/TOKEN`, optional password) via
  public WebDAV; students need no account.
- Offline, Nextcloud actions are disabled with a message; nothing else changes.

### Nextcloud for administrators: CORS

Unless Ofimeo is served from the Nextcloud address, the browser needs
Nextcloud to allow its origin (CORS). Options:

1. **Same address (recommended)**: copy `dist/` to e.g.
   `https://cloud.school.org/office/` (nginx: `location ^~ /office/ { alias
   /var/www/words-online/; }`; Apache: `Alias /office /var/www/words-online`).
   No CORS needed; everything works, including the login flow.
2. **The Nextcloud app "WebAppPassword"**: add the Ofimeo origin to its
   allowed WebDAV origins. Covers WebDAV (browse, open, save) with app
   passwords; not the login flow, revocation or share-link uploads.
3. **CORS headers in the web server**, limited to the Ofimeo origin and
   to `remote.php/dav`, `public.php/dav|webdav`, `ocs/v2.php/core/apppassword`
   and `login/v2`, answering the `OPTIONS` preflight, allowing the
   `Authorization`, `Depth`, `Destination`, `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`
   and `OCS-APIRequest` headers and exposing `ETag`. Replace
   `https://office.example.org`:

```nginx

Credentials (server, user and app password) are stored in this browser's
`localStorage` and sent only to that Nextcloud; see *Security notes* in
[docs/nextcloud.md](docs/nextcloud.md).

## How collaboration works

1. Click **Share**, pick a link (*Can edit*, *Can comment*, *Can view* or
   *Makes a copy*) and send it (or show the QR code).
2. Whoever opens it joins the document; edits sync in real time.

```
 Browser A ◄──── WebRTC (direct, encrypted) ────► Browser B
     │                                                │
     └──── Nostr relays (public WebSockets) ──────────┘
           only to find each other and exchange connection offers
```

- Links look like `…/#app=writer&doc=<id>&key=<secret>&edit=<edit key>`. The
  fragment after `#` is never sent to any server, and routing works on any
  static host.
- Signaling goes through [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) over
  several public Nostr relays at once. Offers are encrypted with the document
  key, so only people with the link can connect.
- Document data travels over WebRTC data channels (DTLS-encrypted). Every peer
  relays updates to its other peers, so everyone converges even if one pair of
  browsers cannot connect directly.
- There is no central copy: at least one other participant must be online to
  receive changes; offline edits merge the next time they meet.

To use your own Nostr relays, add them to the URL (share links keep it):
`https://your-host/?relays=wss://relay1.example,wss://relay2.example`

### Permissions (edit, comment, view)

Permissions are enforced with signatures, not only in the interface
(`src/core/keys.ts`, `src/core/network.ts`):

- Every new document has an Ed25519 *edit key* (WebCrypto); the *comment key*
  is derived from it. The edit link carries the edit key; the comment link the
  comment key plus the public edit key; the view link only the two public
  keys. All links also carry the room key, needed to connect.
- Editors sign every change they send. Peers apply document changes only when
  they are signed with the edit key, and comments (a separate shared document,
  `session.commentsDoc`) only when signed with the comment key. State sent to a
  newcomer is signed too, so nothing unsigned is ever accepted.
- Viewers and commenters forward signed changes verbatim and keep them in a
  signed log (IndexedDB), so they can pass the document on even when no editor
  is online. Editors regularly send a signed checkpoint that keeps that log short.
- Access comes from the keys a link holds: editing a view link's URL cannot
  turn it into an edit link, and a change forced from the browser's developer
  tools stays in that browser. A link whose keys do not match the document is
  refused.
- The home screen marks documents you can only view or comment on.
- Documents created before permission links (links without keys) keep working
  as before: every link can edit. Make a copy to get permission links.
- Permission links need a secure origin (https or localhost). On plain http
  new documents are created without keys.

### Copies and template links

- **File → Make a copy** creates a private copy in this browser (new keys, full
  edit, no history or comments) titled "Copy of …".
- The *Makes a copy* share link (`…&copy=1`) gives everyone who opens it their
  own copy, e.g. a worksheet for each student. The page waits until the content
  arrives from someone who has the document open (the teacher's browser, or
  anyone who viewed it before), explains the wait if it takes long, then opens
  the copy.

### Hand in

The **Hand in** button (next to Share) downloads, in one click, a ZIP named
`<your name> - <title>.zip` with the document in its original formats and a
`README.txt` (title, author, date): `.odt` + `.docx` (documents), `.ods` +
`.xlsx` (spreadsheets), `.excalidraw` + `.png` (drawings), `.drawio` + PNG and
SVG of every page (diagrams). It then offers *Print / Save as PDF* and
*Upload to a Nextcloud share link…* (see [Nextcloud](#nextcloud)).

### Version history

- Versions are stored in the document (`versions` array), so every
  collaborator sees them. Editors save one automatically at most every 10
  minutes while editing, and named ones with **File → Save version…**.
- **File → Version history…** lists them (time, author, name). Anyone can open a
  version as a new copy; editors can restore one for everyone (the current
  state is saved first).
- Named versions are kept; automatic ones are thinned out (the latest ten, then
  one per day).
- An `authors` map in the document records who edited (name and color per
  Yjs client).

Each app and each converter is a separate chunk, loaded only when used.

## Development

`npm run dev` and `npm run build` first run `npm run prepare:assets`, which
copies Excalidraw's fonts into `public/excalidraw` and builds draw.io's shape
libraries into `public/diagram-libs` (both generated, not committed). The
libraries come from the draw.io release pinned in `scripts/drawio.json`
(downloaded once into `node_modules/.cache`, checked against its SHA-256);
`DRAWIO_WAR_DIR=<unpacked draw.war>` uses a local copy instead, and `FORCE=1`
rebuilds.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # dev server, reachable on the LAN
npm run build     # type-check and build into dist/
npm run preview   # serve the production build
npm test          # grammar rule tests + end-to-end tests (build first)
```

### Tests

- `npm run test:unit`: grammar rule tests (`scripts/test-spell.mjs`).
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright tests in `tests/e2e/` against the production
  build (`vite preview`) and a local Nostr relay (`tests/relay.mjs`), never
  public relays: every app opens without errors, the UI language follows the
  browser, two browsers edit the same document, `.drawio`/HTML files open from
  the home screen, and the installed app works offline.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the type check, both test
  suites and the build on every pull request and on pushes to `main`; the
  Playwright report is attached to failed runs.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on
every push to `main` (enable *Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions*).
The build uses relative paths, so any static host or subfolder works.

## Limitations

- Public relays are community-run with no guarantees; several are used at once.
- Some restrictive networks can block direct WebRTC connections between
  different networks. No TURN server is configured.
- Pagination moves whole blocks to the next page (paragraphs are not split
  across pages); a block taller than a page overflows.
- Word/ODT: only the default header/footer, a single section, plain-text
  footnotes; text boxes and floating shapes are not imported. Tracked
  formatting changes are not imported; comments on header/footer text are
  dropped. Equations cover common constructs (fractions, roots, scripts,
  sums/integrals, matrices, accents, delimiters); exotic OMML/MathML may lose
  structure.
  Legacy `.doc` is not supported.
- Documents created with the earlier Quill-based version are not migrated, nor
  diagrams made with the earlier embedded draw.io version.
- Diagrams: draw.io's shape libraries are included except the few that need
  its editor (layout containers of *Advanced*); shapes whose code is not
  available render as rectangles but are kept in the file. Shape-specific
  editing handles (e.g. dragging a BPMN or mockup parameter) are not available
  for library shapes. Library images are not embedded in SVG/PNG downloads.
  No Visio import; math and custom web fonts are not rendered.
- Presentations: no animations or transitions besides a fade; PowerPoint and
  OpenDocument downloads turn library shapes, curved connectors, hand-drawn
  shapes and equations into pictures, and gradient backgrounds into a picture.
  PowerPoint import skips charts, SmartArt, animations and embedded media, and
  uses the first stop of gradient fills in shapes. The presenter view needs
  pop-ups allowed; opening it may leave full screen (use F or the ⛶ button).
- Credits: the "More shapes" libraries are draw.io's (JGraph Ltd / draw.io AG):
  the code and palettes are Apache-2.0; the stencils and icons carry an extra
  restriction (they may not be used in, or distributed for, Atlassian products
  or its marketplace; diagrams made with them are not affected). The generated
  `diagram-libs/` folder keeps that `LICENSE` and a `NOTICE`.
- Spelling and grammar: only paragraph-level languages (not single words);
  suggestions are ranked by edit distance, without word frequencies; Harper
  covers English only and its messages are in English; the offline rules are
  deliberately few (precision over recall) and German noun capitalization is
  left to the dictionary. The sheet's cell editor draws text on a canvas, so the
  browser's spell checker cannot underline there; diagram and slide labels and
  speaker notes use the browser's spell checker in the interface language.
- Credits: dictionaries from [wooorm/dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries),
  each under its own license and served as separate files with it
  (`dictionaries/<lang>-LICENSE.txt`): Spanish from RLA-ES / LibreOffice
  (GPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0 or MPL-1.1), Galician from hunspell-gl (GPL-3.0), English
  from SCOWL / wordlist.aspell.net (MIT and BSD), French from Grammalecte
  (MPL-2.0), German from igerman98 by Björn Jacke (GPL-2.0 or GPL-3.0).
  English grammar by Harper (Apache-2.0).
- Nextcloud: one account per browser; saving exports the whole file (no
  partial or collaborative editing of the file in Nextcloud); a file opened in
  a format the app cannot write (e.g. `.md`, `.tsv`) is saved with *Save to
  Nextcloud as…*; image formats (PNG/SVG) save the current page only. Without
  CORS configured on the server (or the same address), nothing can connect.
- Spreadsheet: the app bundle is large (~2 MB gzipped, loaded only when a sheet
  is opened). Univer's paid features (charts, pivot tables, native printing,
  official collaboration server) are not used. The mutation log is never
  pruned, so very long-lived sheets keep growing in storage (checkpoints keep
  loading fast).
