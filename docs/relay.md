# Ofimeo Relay: collaboration on school networks

Ofimeo runs in the browser and has no server. To edit a document together,
browsers find each other through public *Nostr relays* (WebSocket servers on
the Internet) and then connect directly with *WebRTC*. Many school networks
break one of these steps:

- a **content filter** or firewall blocks the public relays, so browsers never
  find each other;
- a **strict firewall** blocks the UDP traffic WebRTC uses;
- **Wi-Fi client isolation** stops devices on the same Wi-Fi from reaching
  each other.

The result is the same everywhere: people see **"Only you"**. A web page cannot
discover other devices on the local network or accept incoming connections, so
the fix needs a small program on the school network: **Ofimeo Relay**.

## Do you need it? Run the connection test

In Ofimeo, open **Help → Connection test…** (or click the connection status next
to *Share*). It checks, on the device where it runs:

| Check | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Internet access | The device reaches the Internet at all. |
| Servers to find each other (Nostr relays) | Each relay in use: works (time to answer) or blocked. |
| Local network address, public address (STUN), relay server (TURN) | Which kinds of WebRTC connections are possible. |
| Data through the relay (TURN) | A real message sent through the school relay's TURN server (only with a school relay). |
| People in this document | For each person connected: direct on the local network, direct over the Internet, or through the relay, with the round-trip time. |

It ends with a verdict:

- **Collaboration works directly on this network**: nothing to do. If people on
  the same Wi-Fi still see "Only you", the Wi-Fi probably isolates clients:
  install the relay.
- **Collaboration works only through the school relay**: the relay is doing its
  job.
- **Collaboration may not work on this network**: something is partly blocked
  (for example STUN, or the relay's TURN port); the text says what.
- **Blocked: ask your IT department to install Ofimeo Relay**.

**Copy report** puts a plain-text summary on the clipboard to send to the IT
department.

## How it works

```
 Browser A ──── wss://relay/nostr (find each other) ──── Browser B
     │                                                      │
     └── WebRTC direct, or relayed by TURN (UDP/TCP 3478) ──┘
                         Ofimeo Relay
```

One program provides:

- a **Nostr relay** (the subset Trystero needs: `EVENT`, `REQ`, `CLOSE`, `EOSE`),
  in memory only, at `wss://<relay>/nostr`;
- a **STUN/TURN server** ([pion/turn](https://github.com/pion/turn)) on UDP and
  TCP 3478, and TURN over TLS on the HTTPS port, that relays WebRTC traffic
  when devices cannot reach each other;
- `https://<relay>/ofimeo/config`: the relay's Nostr address and ICE servers
  with **time-limited TURN credentials** (valid 24 hours by default; the app
  renews them before they expire), so no password is stored in the web app;
- a **status page** at `https://<relay>/ofimeo/`: the relay address to paste in
  Ofimeo, a link and QR code for students, connected browsers, TURN
  connections, certificate status and ports;
- optionally, the **Ofimeo web app itself** (`--serve-app`), for networks
  without Internet.

Documents stay end-to-end encrypted: signaling messages are encrypted with the
document key, and WebRTC data (also when relayed by TURN) is encrypted with
DTLS. The relay never sees document contents.

## Quick start

1. Download the file for your system from the
   [releases](https://github.com/gafapa/words-online/releases) (tags
   `relay-v…`):

   | System | File |
   | --- | --- |
   | Windows | `ofimeo-relay-windows-amd64.exe` (ARM: `…-windows-arm64.exe`) |
   | macOS, Apple Silicon | `ofimeo-relay-darwin-arm64` |
   | macOS, Intel | `ofimeo-relay-darwin-amd64` |
   | Linux, PC | `ofimeo-relay-linux-amd64` |
   | Raspberry Pi (64-bit OS) | `ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64` |
   | Raspberry Pi (32-bit OS) | `ofimeo-relay-linux-armv7` |

   `ofimeo-relay-full-…` files are the same program with the Ofimeo web app
   inside (see [Serving the app](#serving-the-app-from-the-relay)).
2. Run it on a computer that stays on and is connected to the school network
   (by cable if possible). It prints the **relay address**, e.g.
   `https://192.168.1.20` (or `https://192.168.1.20:8443` when port 443 is not
   available).
3. Make devices trust its certificate (see [Certificates](#certificates)).
4. Give the address to people. Either:
   - share the **link for students** from the status page
     (`https://<app>/?relay=https://192.168.1.20`) or its QR code: opening it
     configures the relay, and every document shared from there carries it; or
   - in Ofimeo, **Help → Connection test… → School relay**, paste the address
     and choose **Use this relay**.
5. Run the connection test on a student device.

The app uses the school relay **together with** the public relays, so the same
links keep working at home. Tick **Use only the school relay** (or add
`&relaymode=only` to the link) to stop using public servers on that device.

## Installing

The program has no dependencies. Before installing it as a service, put it in
its final place (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Ofimeo Relay\` or
`/usr/local/bin/`): the service runs it from there. Its data (settings, certificates, the TURN
secret) is kept in a *data folder*: `%AppData%\ofimeo-relay` (Windows),
`~/Library/Application Support/ofimeo-relay` (macOS) or
`~/.config/ofimeo-relay` (Linux) when run by a user, and
`C:\ProgramData\Ofimeo Relay`, `/Library/Application Support/Ofimeo Relay` or
`/var/lib/ofimeo-relay` when installed as a service. `--data <folder>` chooses
another one.

### Windows

1. Double-click `ofimeo-relay-windows-amd64.exe`. If SmartScreen warns, choose
   **More info → Run anyway**. Allow it in the Windows Firewall prompt
   (**Private networks**).
2. A window shows the relay address; keep it open.
3. To run it as a service (starts with Windows, no window), open a Command
   Prompt **as administrator** in the download folder:

   ```bat
   ofimeo-relay-windows-amd64.exe install-service
   ```

   Remove it with `uninstall-service`. Options given after `install-service`
   (for example `--https-port 8443`) are kept for the service.

### macOS

```sh
chmod +x ofimeo-relay-darwin-arm64
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ofimeo-relay-darwin-arm64   # the binary is not notarized
./ofimeo-relay-darwin-arm64
```

As a service (launchd, starts at boot): `sudo ./ofimeo-relay-darwin-arm64 install-service`.
Allow incoming connections if the macOS firewall asks.

### Linux and Raspberry Pi

```sh
chmod +x ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64
./ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64                       # try it (ports 8443 and 8080 as a user)
sudo ./ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64 install-service  # systemd service, uses port 443
```

On a Raspberry Pi, `uname -m` says `aarch64` (use `linux-arm64`) or `armv7l`
(use `linux-armv7`). A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 is enough for a whole school.
Check the service with `systemctl status ofimeo-relay` and
`journalctl -u ofimeo-relay`. To install it by hand instead, copy the binary to
`/usr/local/bin/ofimeo-relay` and use a unit like:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Ofimeo Relay
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ofimeo-relay run --data /var/lib/ofimeo-relay
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Ports to open

| Port | Protocol | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 443 (or `--https-port`, 8443 when 443 is not available) | TCP | Status page, `/ofimeo/config`, Nostr relay (wss), TURN over TLS |
| 3478 (`--turn-port`) | UDP and TCP | STUN and TURN |
| 49152–65535 (`--relay-ports`) | UDP | Relayed WebRTC traffic (one port per relayed connection) |
| 80 (or 8080; `--http-port -1` turns it off) | TCP | Certificate download page, Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, redirect to https |

Devices must reach these ports **on the relay** (open them in the relay
computer's firewall, and between VLANs if students and the relay are on
different ones). The relay itself needs no Internet access. With Wi-Fi client
isolation, devices can usually still reach wired servers or the gateway; if the
isolation also blocks the relay, add an exception for its address.

A narrower range for relayed traffic, e.g. `--relay-ports 50000-50999`, is
enough for about a thousand simultaneous relayed connections.

## Certificates

Ofimeo is served over https (for example from GitHub Pages), and a secure page
can only open `wss://` and `https://` connections to servers with a trusted
certificate. So the relay needs one of:

1. **Let's Encrypt** (automatic): `--domain relay.myschool.org`. The name must
   point to the relay and Let's Encrypt must reach it on port 443 or 80 from
   the Internet. Certificates are renewed automatically.
2. **A certificate from the school** (for example a wildcard certificate of the
   school's domain, whose DNS name points to the relay's local address):
   `--cert fullchain.pem --key privkey.pem`. The files are reloaded when they
   change, so they can be renewed by certbot or lego (DNS-01 works for
   addresses that are only reachable inside the school).
3. **The relay's own certificate authority** (the default, local network
   only): on first run the relay creates a small certificate authority and a
   certificate for its names and local addresses. Each device must trust that
   authority once:
   - by hand: open `http://<relay>/ofimeo/ca` (or `https://<relay>/ofimeo/ca`,
     accepting the warning once) and follow the instructions for Windows,
     macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Android or iPhone/iPad;
   - by policy (recommended): push `ca-cert.pem` from the data folder to all
     managed devices (Google Admin console for Chromebooks, Intune or Group
     Policy for Windows, an MDM profile for Apple devices).

   The authority is **name-constrained**: it can only issue certificates for
   private addresses and local names (`.local`, `.lan`, `.internal`, the
   machine's name…), so trusting it cannot be abused to impersonate Internet
   sites. Its SHA-256 fingerprint is shown on the certificate page. If the
   relay's name or network changes to one outside those limits, delete
   `ca-cert.pem` and `ca-key.pem` in the data folder and install the new one.

TURN over UDP and TCP (`turn:` addresses) does not need a trusted certificate;
TURN over TLS (`turns:`) does.

**Chrome and "local network access"**: when Ofimeo is opened from the Internet
(e.g. GitHub Pages) and the relay has a private address, recent versions of
Chrome may ask whether the site may **access other devices on your local
network**: choose *Allow*. Administrators can allow it for all users with the
Chrome policy `LocalNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls` (the app's address). The relay
answers Private Network Access preflights. Serving the app from the relay
avoids the question altogether.

## Serving the app from the relay

With `--serve-app`, the relay also serves the Ofimeo web app, so a school can
work entirely on its own network, even without Internet:

```sh
ofimeo-relay-full-linux-arm64 --serve-app embedded     # the full build has the app inside
ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64 --serve-app ofimeo-app.zip    # or the app zip from the release
ofimeo-relay-linux-arm64 --serve-app /path/to/dist     # or a folder (npm run build)
```

Students open `https://<relay>/` (the status page shows the link and a QR
code). The app detects that it is served by the relay and uses it
automatically; nothing needs to be pasted. It installs as an app and works
offline as usual.

## Configuration

Settings are read from `ofimeo-relay.json` in the data folder (created with
the defaults on first run); command-line options override them. `ofimeo-relay
--help` lists the options (`ofimeo-relay ayuda` in Spanish).

| Option | File key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--data` | | see above | Data folder |
| `--name` | `name` | Ofimeo Relay | Name on the status page |
| `--host` | `host` | detected LAN address | Name or IP devices use to reach the relay (put in links and TURN addresses) |
| `--https-port` | `https_port` | 443, else 8443 | HTTPS, wss and TURN over TLS |
| `--http-port` | `http_port` | 80, else 8080 | Plain http helper (`-1`: off) |
| `--turn-port` | `turn_port` | 3478 | STUN/TURN, UDP and TCP |
| `--turn-tls-port` | `turn_tls_port` | same as HTTPS | Separate TURN over TLS port (`-1`: off) |
| `--relay-ports` | `relay_port_min`, `relay_port_max` | 49152-65535 | UDP ports for relayed traffic |
| `--domain`, `--acme-email` | `domain`, `acme_email` | | Let's Encrypt |
| `--cert`, `--key` | `cert_file`, `key_file` | | Certificate files (PEM) |
| `--serve-app` | `serve_app` | | `embedded`, a folder or a .zip of the web app |
| `--app-url` | `app_url` | the public Ofimeo | App address used in the link for students |
| `--public` | `public` | false | Accept devices from any address |
| `--allow-networks` | `allow_networks` | | Extra address ranges treated as local (CIDR list) |
| `--credential-ttl` | `credential_ttl` | 24h | Validity of TURN credentials |
| `--log-file` | `log_file` | | Also log to this file |
| | `max_clients`, `max_subscriptions`, `max_event_bytes`, `events_per_minute`, `max_allocations`, `max_allocations_per_ip` | 2000, 64, 65536, 600, 16000, 600 | Limits |

The TURN shared secret is generated on first run and kept in `turn-secret` in
the data folder; it never leaves the relay.

## Security notes

- **Local network only by default**: the relay refuses devices whose address is
  not private (10.x, 172.16–31.x, 192.168.x, 100.64.x, IPv6 unique-local,
  loopback) for every service, including TURN. `--allow-networks` adds ranges
  (for schools that use public addresses internally); `--public` accepts
  everyone, for example for students at home, and should come with a real
  certificate and a firewall in front.
- **Time-limited credentials**: TURN credentials follow the TURN REST
  convention (username `<expiry>:ofimeo`, password HMAC-SHA1 with the secret),
  expire after `credential_ttl`, and are handed out only by `/ofimeo/config`,
  to devices allowed to use the relay.
- **What TURN may reach**: relayed traffic may only go to devices on the local
  network (or anywhere with `--public`), never to the relay machine's loopback
  addresses.
- **Limits**: maximum browsers, subscriptions per browser, event size, events
  per minute per browser, and TURN allocations in total and per device.
- **Nothing is stored**: signaling messages are checked (id and signature),
  kept in memory for two minutes and then dropped. Document contents never
  reach the relay unencrypted.
- The status page shows only counts, no addresses or document information.

## Troubleshooting

- **The connection test says the school relay cannot be reached**: open its
  address in the browser. A certificate warning means the device does not trust
  the relay's certificate authority yet (see [Certificates](#certificates)); a
  timeout means a firewall blocks the HTTPS port or the address is wrong.
- **"Data through the relay (TURN)" fails** while the relay is reachable: UDP
  and TCP 3478 (and the relayed UDP range) are blocked between the device and
  the relay.
- **Everyone connects but only through TURN**: normal with Wi-Fi client
  isolation; the relay forwards the traffic. A Raspberry Pi handles a school.
- **Port 443 is in use**: the relay falls back to 8443; the relay address then
  includes `:8443`.
- **After changing the relay setting in the app**, reload open documents.

## Building from source

```sh
cd relay
go test ./...
go build -o ofimeo-relay .                 # this machine
VERSION=1.0.0 ./build.sh                   # every platform, into relay/dist/
FULL=1 ./build.sh                          # also the -full builds (needs npm run build first)
```

Pushing a tag like `relay-v1.0.0` runs `.github/workflows/relay-release.yml`,
which builds every platform and attaches the files to a GitHub Release.
